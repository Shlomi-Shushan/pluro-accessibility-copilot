# 🚀 Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to Pluro Copilot!

### 📋 License Setup (Required for Advanced Features)

Before using advanced features, you'll need to set up your license:

1. **Purchase a License**: Visit [https://pluro.ai](https://pluro.ai) to purchase a commercial license
2. **Get Your API Key**: After purchase, you'll receive your unique API key
3. **Configure in VS Code**:
   - Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "Pluro"
   - Enter your API key in the "Pluro API Token" field
4. **Verify Connection**: Use "Pluro: Test API Connection" from Command Palette

**Note**: Basic scanning features work without a license, but advanced features require a valid license key.

### 🎯 First Steps

1. **Open a file:** Start with an HTML, JSX, or supported file
2. **Run your first scan:** Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type "Pluro: Scan Current File"
3. **View results:** Check the Problems panel for detected issues
4. **Fix issues:** Use Quick Fix (lightbulb or right-click menu) if available
